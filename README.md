## Why I made this project

This was one of my first projects I ever made in lua. At first I attempted to make it as clean as possible and it's pretty clean but the code is still very spagettish.

I will be updating this until it's fully finished.




## Up & Coming

- All other features
- Ace Permissions support


## Requirements

You will need the following to be able to run Menuss

- [`menuv`](https://github.com/ThymonA/menuv)
