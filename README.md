## Why I made this project

This was one of my first projects I ever made in lua. At first I attempted to make it as clean as possible and it's pretty clean but the code is still very spagettish.

I will be updating this until it's fully finished however I'm hoping the community can help out, adding their own features. It doesn't event have to be from Menyoo.




## Up & Coming
